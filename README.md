## Rationale

The cunning plan of this library is to improve understanding of planning fundamentals.

* To demonstrate the concepts of path and motion planning as clearly as possible 
  without worrying a great deal about performance.
* To demonstrate a composable approach to planning through algebraic data types
  or the closest python equivalent, union types.
* To avoid coupling the reference implementations with extraneous requirements 
  (configuration and plotting).
